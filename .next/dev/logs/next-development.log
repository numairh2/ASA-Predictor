The export INITIAL_TEAMS was not found in module [project]/Desktop/ASA Predictor/data/teams.ts [app-ssr] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import INITIAL_TEAMS_36?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
